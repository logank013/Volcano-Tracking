# Volcano Ash and SO2 Tracking  
Project Partner: Anna Everett

## Data
This data comes from the IEEE 2014 SciVis contest. For the processed data we used, please contact me at loganrkreisher@gmail.com. The original dataset on the 2014 contest website does not appear to be available anymore.

## Visuals
The visualizations come from 2 separate volcanic eruptions. The first eruption in Southern Chile, the Puyehue eruption, happened on June 4, 2011 and the second eruption in North East Africa, Eritrea, took place on June 11 2011. The Ash Index visualizations are from the Chile eruption. The SO2 visualizations are from the Eritrea eruption.

In the visuals folder, there are 2 static images overlaying 5 days (10 frames) of data. Each frame is a 12 hour step of satellite tracking data.

#### Animations:  
ASH Index Visualization: https://youtu.be/MGq7XvG1Xr0  
SO2 Visualization: https://youtu.be/8MZCOWxGmfo

As you can see in the animations, the 12 hour passes do not cover the entire earth in that time period. However, stringing together the steps into an animation shows more about the eruptions as a whole.

## State Files
The state files included are to be used with the scientific visualization software, ParaView. With ParaView, you can look at these models in 3 dimensional form and rotate around the models.
